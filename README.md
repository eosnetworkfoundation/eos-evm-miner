# EOS EVM Miner

This tool allows you to accept Ethereum transactions and relay them to the EOS EVM.

For every transaction that you relay you will receive a reward in the form of EOS tokens.

## Usage

> âš  **You must have registered your miner**
>
> You must have registered your miner account on the EOS Network. [Head over to our

> mining, claiming your rewards, and more.


### Get the code

```bash
git clone https://github.com/eosnetworkfoundation/eos-evm-miner.git
cd eos-evm-miner
```

### Install dependencies

```bash
yarn
```
OR
```bash
npm install
```

### Environment Variables
Copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the environment variables.

### Start mining

This command will build and run the node.

```bash
yarn mine
```
OR
```bash
npm run mine
```

If you want to just run the node without building, you can run:

```bash
yarn start
```
OR
```bash
npm run start
```


## Logging

This project uses [Winston](https://github.com/winstonjs/winston) for logging.

When you run the miner a directory called `logs` will be created in the root of the project. 
Inside you will find two log files, `combined.log` and `error.log`.
